# FordGoBike Data Exploration

## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding 519,700 bike trips that different 
types of customers have made.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that the proportion of bike users of "Subscriber" type 
is significantly higher than the ones of "Customer" type. Given that, the month 
when the highest amounts of bike trips occur is October and weekday is Tuesday. The 
distribution of the trip length over the months shows that most trips are around 10 
minutes long. However, the "Customer" type user spends much more time (>35 mins) on the bike 
compared to the "Subscriber" type. Finally, the "Customer" type user rents out bikes 
most often over the weekend where the "Subscriber" type user is using bikes mostly 
on weekdays. The hours that the "Customer" type is using the system is between 11-17 whereas 
the "Subscriber" type mostly uses the bike between hours 7-9 and 16-18.

Concluding, the findings shows very different behavior between the 2 type of users of the FordGoBike 
system. Therefore, the marketing strategy of the company to increase use of the system should 
be quite different for each user type. Namely, incentives like discounts and special offers should 
be given to the "Customer" type within the weekend and the exact opposite should be offered to the
"Subscriber" type.
